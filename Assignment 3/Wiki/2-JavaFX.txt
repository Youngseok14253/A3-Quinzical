### Adding JavaFX (commit no. 6)

There was a slight problem on my (Eugene's) Eclipse repository where my project could not detect the JavaFX library which was weird, 
considering Daniel's pull from the repository seemed to work fine for him. We managed to fix it in the end by deleting the GitHub 
repo from Eclipse, and re-cloning it back.
